Abstract: This study presented a successful pipeline for the Random Forest-based method of GRN inference for the CAM community for the first time and returned the candidate transcription factors of key CAM genes for each functional subnetwork

### Description of the code
This code shows the implementation of dynGENIE3 algorithm and transcriptome data of K. fedtschenkoi.


### Note
This implementation reports . . .
